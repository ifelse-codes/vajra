# PreToolUse(Bash): enforces one-vajra-session-per-chat (AGENTS.md step 10).
#
# The Hard Rule: a new vajra-session starts in a NEW chat. The chat that closed
# session N must NOT begin session N+1's BRANCH/PLAN in the same chat. Until now
# this was convention only (CONSTRAINTS.yaml#session.one_session_per_chat: true);
# this hook makes it real.
#
# Signal: the Claude `session_id` (the chat). We record which chat "owns" each
# vajra-session number the first time it creates that session's branch. When a
# `git checkout -b session-NN-*` crosses the N->N+1 boundary FROM THE SAME CHAT
# that owned N, we block: open a new chat first.
#
# Maturity-gated (same gate as every Vajra hook, S21):
#   L1    -> ADVISE  : warn on stdout, exit 0 (agent may proceed).
#   L2/L3 -> ENFORCE : warn on stderr, exit 2 (branch creation blocked).
# Only active when CONSTRAINTS.yaml#session.one_session_per_chat: true.
#
# Test/override knobs (used by verify-session-26.sh to drive the boundary without
# real chats): VAJRA_SESSION_OWNER_FILE overrides the owner record path;
# VAJRA_GUARD_MATURITY overrides the maturity level read from CONSTRAINTS.yaml.

#   1. checkout of the next branch: git checkout -b session-NN-<slug>   (NN = the new session).
#   2. `vajra next --advance` (S39, story A — the S36 root cause). The S36 brownfield agent
#      advanced 00->01 WITHOUT ever `checkout -b`, so the branch tripwire never armed and it
#      ran two vajra-sessions in one chat, unstopped. `--advance` is Vajra's ONE sanctioned
#      advance command; it bumps .ai/SESSION via Rust `fs::write` (invisible to a Bash hook as
#      a file write), so the invocation itself is the observable common-denominator signal.
#      For an advance the target session is (current .ai/SESSION) + 1. (A raw manual
#      `echo N > .ai/SESSION` is out of scope here — tracked for git-level pre-commit
#      scaffolding; enforcement stays fail-safe: unrecognised advances simply don't arm.)
