# Vajra — Current State Snapshot

**Snapshot, not log.** Overwritten in full at every closeout.

## Active Branch
**`session-177-keep-testing` — S177 complete on its branch; PR to open (the founder merges).**

## What was done this session (S177 - interactive, the founder's rudra session 09)

- **rudra S09 (3h20m in chat):** close check 21/21 on the branch before the PR; the agent pushed and opened PR #11, the founder merged. F31 clean 9th time; F66 all 7 handoffs tracked; F58 exercised live. ~1h50m of the run was waiting on his answers; the code took 25 min; Vajra's steps ≈ 50 min.
- **F74 (fixed):** the scaffold close gate (`scripts/verify-closeout-scaffold.sh` → every project's `scripts/verify-closeout.sh`) ignored `ground_truth_next_session`. The founder moved rudra's GT to S15; S10 (CODE) would have skipped "scripts exist" + "tech-lead recorded" as N/A (rudra S05 already had). It now carries S175's helper at both sites.
- **F76 (fixed with it):** the scaffold's `is_code_session` matched only `**CODE**`; every rudra brief writes `**CODE.**`, so its tech-lead check never ran. Accepts `**CODE[.:,]**` now; old vs new over 151 prompts in both repos: 17 non-CODE → CODE, 0 back.
- **Disclosed (cold review):** a key naming a non-multiple-of-5 session makes that session review-only (intended; key is agent-writable, parked). Rebuilt, installed, synced into rudra (uncommitted there — its S10 agent commits it).
- Verify 12/12 · demo 6/6 · 598 tests · review ACCEPT (8/8).

## Previous session (S176 - interactive, the founder's rudra sessions 07 + 08)

- F70 fixed (Planner Dangling state); F72 (table-style Acceptance read). `sessions/session-176-summary.md`.

## What Currently Works

- The close gate refuses made-up evidence: prose/malformed/non-existent `done:` shas, unlanded plan steps, unbacked verdict claims, a CODE session with no tech-lead (S169).
- A demo that cannot be faked: command-backed checks, Vajra-filled numbers, gate re-derives facts at close (S168).
- Terminal demo deck for every Vajra project: `scripts/demo-kit.sh` + the seven-section template (S167).
- `vajra init --sync-fleet` upgrades fleet roles + hooks + constitution + close gate + demo template + kit.
- 10-role fleet, THREE mandatory (`fidelity-reviewer`, `design-advisor`, `tech-lead`); 8 stations + closeout gate (19+ checks); tamper-evident ledger; receipts.
- **The ground-truth cadence is config-driven (S175):** `.ai/CONSTRAINTS.yaml#ground_truth_next_session` overrides the every-5th default in all 6 sites that read it; absent behaves byte-for-byte as before.
- **The scaffold close gate honours a moved ground truth and `**CODE.**` briefs (S177):** a project's CODE session gets its full close checks after the founder moves the next GT.
- **The Planner checks `covers: N` both ways (S176):** a plan citing acceptance items the brief lacks blocks; `| ACn |` tables are read.
- **`VAJRA_ALLOW_PUBLISH=1` no longer covers merge (S175):** `gh pr merge`/`glab mr merge` always fall to the founder, matching the boundary `VAJRA_ALLOW_COMMIT` (F55) already held.

## What Is Broken / Weak / Disclosed

- **🟡 Release 0.2.0 half done** — tag `v0.2.0` + GitHub release out; **crates.io still 0.1.0** (founder types `cargo publish`); brew tap formula is at 0.2.0 but install-smoke not run (ROADMAP `S168-release`). A stranger's `cargo install` gets none of S167–S175. Founder's own installed `vajra` is 0.2.0 (reinstalled for S174's fixes, 2026-09-22 — not yet rebuilt with S175's bash-only changes, which need no rebuild since nothing in `src/` moved).
- **🟡 S169 fakest green:** the claim match is words only; claimed-evidence proves files exist, not that they are real; a made-up `done:` sha is still waivable; `git cat-file -e` accepts any old commit → **parked — policing** (ROADMAP `S171-parked`).
- **🟢 F31 clean nine times (S171–S177, incl. rudra S07–S09).**
- **🔴 The backstop is gone (S172, disclosed):** a skipped `verify-closeout.sh` used to be caught at the next session's start; it is caught nowhere now. Running the close check on the branch before the merge is the whole enforcement story, and it is a text rule. DECISION-007 S172 addendum.
- **🟡 `shipped_close()` keys on one file** — landing a summary on main early downgrades the closing gates to reporting while a session is live (self-granted jurisdiction, disclosed).
- **🟡 F50/F44 — not fixed in code (S173, by decision):** a commit message that mentions a guarded command still blocks; the block names `git commit -F <file>` / `--body-file`.
- **🟡 F55's `cwd` assumption:** still unverified live — no rudra session has used a worktree yet (S06 didn't either).
- **🟡 The guards' old-vs-new check is a list (S173):** named shapes × triggers; a spelling nobody listed is not covered.
- **🟡 Parked LOW (S173):** F47 copied jargon · F56 the session guard cannot tell a command runs in another project · F57 the Coder check reads only `1. …` plan steps.
- **🔴 F67 (S176, PARKED by founder, 3rd time S177):** the receipt prices `claude-opus-5-5` at the unknown-model ceiling — rudra S07/S08/S09 read ~$48.68/~$62.71/~$118.69, ~5× over. Founder: no new price rows; fix permanently by reading the tool's own cost for interactive runs.
- **🟡 F70-residual (S176, disclosed):** nothing at close re-runs the Planner — a mid-session brief wipe is caught only when someone runs `--check-plan`/`--steps`/`--stations`; deleting the `covers:` markers or the whole `## Plan` still passes (S68 class). A close re-run needs the founder's yes.
- **🟡 S177 disclosed:** Vajra's OWN close gate still matches only `**CODE**` (own paperwork, not changed); `ground_truth_next_session` is agent-writable and unguarded (a key = N session loses its CODE checks); the key is read as the first digits on its line (LOW).
- **🟡 F75 (S177, LOW):** the design-advisor proposed a 4-file commit no agent can make (≤3-file hook); the plan-advisor overruled it.
- **🟡 F71 (S176, PARKED; recurred S177):** a GitHub-button merge leaves the remote session branch; the release check's `pruned` looks at locals only.
- **🟡 F73 (S176, LOW):** `1)`, `**1.**`, numeric tables, `- AC1:` are not read as criteria (a plan citing them now blocks with the right message); `covers:` u32 overflow is dropped.
- **🟡 F66 (S175, disclosed, not fixed):** `--check-crew`/`read_handoff` checks a handoff file's presence on disk, never that it's git-tracked — a session's required crew can close with real handoffs left uncommitted. Same bug family as F60 (Vajra's own sync files), different target. No new gate on Vajra's own paperwork without the founder's explicit yes (Guardrails).
- **🟡 `scripts/verify-closeout-scaffold.sh` (the `vajra init` template) does not carry the S175 cadence-config fix** — deliberate, disclosed (DECISION-007 S175 addendum): a new project has no reason to move its first ground truth on day one, and this file already lags the live gate on other counts (S154's execution-sha tightening, cargo-fmt).
- **🟡 `.ai/ROADMAP.md`'s "NN % 5 == 0 → mandatory NO-CODE GT" pointer line had gone stale for many cycles** (last hand-updated at S120/S125, corrected at S175 to S170/S180) — a reminder that a hand-maintained "next X" pointer drifts unless something derives it.
- **🟡 Not tested:** Windows; a real light-background terminal. **Zero external users**; prove-then-cut-cost arc unstarted; Autopilot Rung 2/3 incomplete.
- **🟡 Backlog carry-forwards** — D2 inner-session gap + waiver path (S161) · crew advice impact F13 · S154-QA 1–3 · S156-FR r1/r2 · S157-FR r2 · S159-FR r1 · S161-FR 2–4 · S164-QA r1 · verify-158 source grep · no gate against new hollow verify checks · Releaser NoBranch blind spot · init.rs hand-typed scaffold scope · waiver BLOCK paths untested.

## What Is In Progress

- Nothing. S177 closed on its branch; PR to open. S178 = the founder's pick (see `sessions/session-177-summary.md`'s 3 ranked candidates).

## Active PRs

- S177's, once opened. S176 merged as #213.

## Direction (governance is the product)

- **Product = provable agent governance** (`DECISION-001`). Direction (2026-09-15): **no more policing — reach a real user.** Founder tests Vajra himself; sessions are interactive from S171.
- **Founder priorities (S140/S160):** (1) fresh-user experience + release; (2) prove it works, then cut cost; (3) self-driving unattended close / Rung 2–3; (4) external adoption.
